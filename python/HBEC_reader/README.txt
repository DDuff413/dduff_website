Holus B. 'Excelsior' Collins (H.B.E.C) 

Your helpful assistent when it come to retreaving very specific information 
from a very specifically formatted .xlsx file.


*******************Setup*******************

Holus requires certain features to run properly, similar to how you need a 
brain or a heart.
Said features are two python libraries that he calls upon to perform his task.

To obtain these python libraries, follow these simple steps:
1. Open command prompt.
2. Navigate to you python script folder.
3. Enter the command "pip install xlrd".
4. Enter the command "pip install xlsxwriter".

!!!An error occured in step...!!!
1. Due to your incompetence you were unable to open command prompt. Don't worry, 
   that's perfectly normal.
	- Press the windows key or through other means navigate to the start search bar.
	- Type 'cmd' and press enter when 'Command Prompt' appears.
2. Due to a your low IQ, you do not know how to navigate in command line interfaces.
   That's fine, you're not as smart as Holus after all.
	- Enter the command : "cd C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Scripts\".
	- If an error occured here. Contact an adult.
3. This one's probably not on you!
	- Try the command "./pip install xlrd" instead.
	- If the error persists, contact an adult.
4. This one's also probably not on you!
	- Try the command "./pip install xlsxwriter" instead.
	- If the error persists, contact an adult.


*******************File Layout*******************

Holus isn't picky. He just likes a certain file format to the point where he 
will not operate without it.

This format is as follows:
	HBEC_Reader.py
	input
		(save your .xlsx files here)
	output
		(leave empty)
	xml
		(place all your .xml files here for convenience)

Assuming the above format is used. There should be no errors in run time.


*******************Run Time*******************

Simply double click or press 'enter' on "HBEC_Reader.py" to wake Holus up.

Holus will greet you and request a file name. This file name should be the name 
of a .xlsx file present in the "input" folder.

!!!Important!!!
The file name must only be the file name and must not inclue the type ".xlsx".

Holus will let you know if something went wrong and will inform you of your 
options.

Upon a successful conversion. Holus will place the output files inside the 
"outpus" folder with the same name as the file provided to Holus.

On the off chance that you accidently wake Holus up and wish to disapoint him
by ending his existence in the most painful way imaginable. Simply type "quit"
and press the 'enter' key.
